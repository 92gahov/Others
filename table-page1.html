                <p>Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (About this soundlisten)) is the capital city of
                    Italy. It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of
                    Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285
                    km2 (496.1 sq mi),[1] Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most
                    populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City
                    of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in
                    Italy.[2] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[3] Rome is located
                    in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the
                    shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[4] is an independent
                    country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a
                    city; for this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[5][6]
                    Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location and also
                    the "Eternal City."[7]

                    Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at
                    around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human
                    settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in
                    Europe.[8] The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and
                    Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the
                    Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city
                    and metropolis. <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" target="_blank">Read

                <p>The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome,
                    Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and
                    several others. Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide,[1] it is
                    the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world.

                    The fountain has appeared in several films, including Roman Holiday (1953), the eponymous
                    Three Coins in the Fountain (1954), Federico Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita (1960), The
                    Lizzie McGuire Movie (2003), and Sabrina Goes to Rome (1998). The fountain at the junction
                    of three roads (tre vie)[3] marks the terminal point[4] of the "modern" Acqua Vergine, the
                    revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome. In 19 BC,
                    supposedly with the help of a virgin, Roman technicians located a source of pure water some
                    13 km (8.1 mi) from the city. (This scene is presented on the present fountain's façade.)
                    However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22 km (14 mi).
                    This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400
                    years. In 1629, Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked
                    Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the
                    pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in
                    the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved
                    in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most
                    unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti[8] one attributed to Ferdinando
                    Fuga[9] and a French design by Edmé Bouchardon.[5]

                    Competitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as
                    well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730, Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola
                    Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei – but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine
                    having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway.[10] Work began in 1732. <span><a

                    Vatican City (/ˈvætɪkən/ (About this soundlisten)), officially the Vatican City State
                    (Italian: Stato della Città del Vaticano;[e] Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[f][g] is an
                    independent city state and enclave located within Rome, Italy.[11][12] The Vatican City
                    State, also known simply as the Vatican, became independent from Italy with the Lateran
                    Treaty (1929), and it is a distinct territory under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and
                    sovereign authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of
                    international law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual
                    independence.[h][13] With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres)[b] and a population of about
                    825,[8] it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population.[14] As governed
                    by the Holy See, the Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state
                    (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic
                    Church.[3][15] The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national
                    origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1437),[16] the popes have mainly resided at the
                    Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the
                    Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. Defined as a public space in the last years of 15th
                    century, when the city market was transferred there from the Campidoglio, Piazza Navona was
                    transformed into a highly significant example of Baroque Roman architecture and art during
                    the pontificate of Innocent X, who reigned from 1644 until 1655, and whose family palace. <span><a
